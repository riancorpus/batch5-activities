    <h1>Nelson Mandela: Father of the Nation</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Nelson Mandela is considered by many to be the father of South Africa.  Mandela was an anti-Apartheid activist, which means that fought for those who were disadvantaged by the system of racial segregation.  Mandela became a civil rights leader, leading many against the Apartheid government.

    Apartheid was a system of racial inequality which kept all races separate from one another. In 1994, Mandela was of key importance in negotiating the freedom and equality of all South Africans.  He then became South Africa’s first democratically elected president.

<h1>Nelson Mandela, South Africa’s Liberator as Prisoner and President, Dies at 95</h1>
<br>
<p>
  Nelson Mandela, who led the emancipation of South Africa from white minority rule and served as his country’s first black president, becoming an international emblem of dignity and forbearance, died Thursday night. He was 95.

The South African president, Jacob Zuma, announced Mr. Mandela’s death.

Mr. Mandela had long said he wanted a quiet exit, but the time he spent in a Pretoria hospital this summer was a clamor of quarreling family, hungry news media, spotlight-seeking politicians and a national outpouring of affection and loss. The vigil eclipsed a visit by President Obama, who paid homage to Mr. Mandela but decided not to intrude on the privacy of a dying man he considered his hero.
