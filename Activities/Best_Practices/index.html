            Everything has to start somewhere. It can be an idea in your mind or a drawing on a piece of paper.
            </li>
            
            <li>

            </li>
            
            <li>
            <h3>Sprint, Don’t Leap</h3> 
            Always maintain a balance between today’s demand and future innovation.
            </li>
            
            <li>
            <h3>Establish multi-device compatibility</h3>
            Front-end users doesn't really know how things work in the backend. So it's better for the developers to create apps/websites that are user-friendly on all devices.
            </li>
            
            </ol>
